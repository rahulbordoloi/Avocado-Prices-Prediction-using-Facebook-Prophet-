1> Data represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price.            
2> Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados.            
3> The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags.                                       
4> The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.                 

To Predict : Price of Avocado over a certain period along with its trends and bounds.
